## What is Minetales?

> **Minetales** is not just another *Minecraft* server where you're gonna waste your time on. **Minetales** is THE *playground* you've always been dreaming of. Our plans for this project, were to create an environment where we could display the best of *Minecraft* community skills, thanks to the possibilities of modern *Minecraft*. The perfect illustration for this, is our cosmetic system, which is **home-made**, with stunnings 3D models.

## What can we do actually on **Minetales**?

> For now, **Minetales** is a in-progress project. We plan on releasing the server on a public beta, with 2 clusters around the world: **USA** & **West Europe**.  
> If you want to support us, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Rv5xRBRVDj) and spread the word among your friends that **Minetales** is coming soon!

<br>

## What kind of minigames will be present on **Minetales**?

> Everything from *PvP* to *building*! We plan to release about 3 or 4 minigames upon the beta.   
> The only thing we can tell actually, is that our first minigame will be a reformated bedwars with our usual modern *Minecraft* touch!
