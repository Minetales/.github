## What is Minetales?

> **Minetales** is not just another *Minecraft* server where you're gonna waste your time on. **Minetales** is THE *playground* you've always been dreaming of. Our plans for this project, were to create an environment where we could display the best of *Minecraft* community skills, thanks to the possibilities of modern *Minecraft*. The perfect illustration for this, is our cosmetic system, which is **home-made**, with stunnings 3D models.
